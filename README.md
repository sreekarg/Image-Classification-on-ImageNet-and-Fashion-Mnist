# Image-Classification-on-ImageNet-and-Fashion-Mnist

Convolution Neural Networks were built on Fashion Mnist dataset and fine tuned to get atleast 92% accuracy.
Later this model was improved by data augmentation to achieve an accuracy of 93.4%

Convolution Neural Network was built on 20 classes in Imagenet dataset, and later the model was improved using data augmentation on specific classes (since the data augmentation on the properly classified classes would only increase its computation time) and yielded an accuracy of 51.7%
